# AI Final Project - Sri Amin

Using PyCaret, we'll be following through the Regressor Beginner Tutorial to implement our own Regressor model that utilizes our own dataset that being the a White Wine Quality Data set. After examining all the available models, we choose the best one being the Light Gradient Boosting Machine, then tuning the model to get the best hyper-parameters and then finalize the model and get it ready for deployment. The performance of the model held up to be quiet optimized having an accuracy score of 0.945.
